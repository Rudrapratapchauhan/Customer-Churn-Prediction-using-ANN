# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ANN
Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service. The goal is to take preemptive actions to retain these customers.
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify customers who are likely to churn. By accurately predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss.

Data Collection
The project involves collecting historical customer data, which includes:

Customer Demographics: Age, gender, location.
Account Information: Subscription plan, contract type.
Service Usage: Usage metrics such as minutes used and data consumed.
Customer Interactions: Number of complaints, support calls.
Financial Information: Monthly charges, total charges, payment methods.
Churn Indicator: A label indicating whether the customer has churned.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step to prepare the data for the ANN. This includes:

Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing any missing values in the dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Building the ANN
The core of the project involves designing and training an ANN. The process includes:

Model Architecture: Constructing the neural network with an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer.
Activation Functions: Using activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.
Compilation: Compiling the model with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function (e.g., binary crossentropy), and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Training and Evaluation
The ANN is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset. The steps include:

Training: Feeding the training data into the model and iteratively adjusting the weights.
Evaluation: Measuring the model’s performance using accuracy and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model by adjusting hyperparameters like the number of layers, neurons per layer, learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Deployment
After achieving satisfactory performance, the model is deployed to a production environment where it can make real-time predictions. This involves:

Creating an API: Setting up an endpoint to serve model predictions.
Integration: Integrating the model with existing business systems to provide actionable insights.
Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure the model remains accurate over time. This includes:

Performance Monitoring: Tracking the model’s performance in real-time.
Retraining: Periodically retraining the model with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
This project demonstrates the practical application of ANNs in predicting customer churn, providing businesses with a powerful tool to enhance customer retention strategies and improve overall profitability.
